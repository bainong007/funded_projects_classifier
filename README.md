# funded_projects_classifier
**Built a classifier to predict if a project from DonorChoose will be funded.**

This is my 3rd project done during the Metis Data Science Boot Camp.

Objective:
The objective is to predict whether a project would be fully funded or expired. This will be used to decide what projects are picked for marketing. To use in business application to add value.

Approach:
Predict whether a project would be funded based on the charaterics of or information related to that project. This is based on the belief that funded project shares similar features.
